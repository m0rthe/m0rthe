# Hello there! I’m Moritz, an aspiring software developer 👋
- 🎓 Until the end of February 2023, I was enrolled at FH Aachen University as a student of Global Business & Economics. Unfortunately, I had to realise that my studies did not suit me as much as I had previously thought. Looking to the future, I can well imagine working in the field of software development with my passion as motivation. That's why I decided to change my career. One of the reasons for this was that I had found my joy for programming during my studies, which started when I got more involved with the subject on the side. 
- 💻📚 Since the beginning of this year I have been actively attending a beginners' course at the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/m0rthe). 
I got my first insights into HTML/CSS and Javascript. I also enjoyed the use of Git in another course. It's a great opportunity to use the many free online courses to teach yourself how to code.
I also plan to complete the [OSSU Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) (Paused).
- 👨🏻‍💻 For the future, I plan to improve my knowledge and upload more projects.
